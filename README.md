# Data-Science-Projects

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Gene Expression Data
  Done using data from a Kaggle data set which was originally based off analysis from a study by (Golub et al. 1999). The       analysis involves using DNA microarray data to look at the different expression patters associated with Acute Lymphocytic     Leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia.
  
## Gene Variant Classification
  Analyzing the differences in lab assignment of gene pathology. Predicting whether or not labs have conflicting conclusions     with regards to the pathology of certain genes.
